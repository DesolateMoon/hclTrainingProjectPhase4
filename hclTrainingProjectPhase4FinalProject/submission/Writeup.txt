This program is a responsive website for a restaurant where users can read the details
of the resturant. It is created utilizing Bootstrap. Following the client's criteria
the website will provide the users a brief overview of the restaurant and its bestsellers, 
its address, as well as an option to contact the restaurant. 

I began the project by creating the main landing page which is named index.html. I was able to quickly 
create a header for Restaurant name followed by a generic greeting for the user. I then created a footer, 
which is the Client's motto. I then created a carousel to display the restaurant's best sellers. After
completing this I moved on to the nav bar which will allow the user to redirect to the home page we just
created as well as two other pages (menu and contact us). I then created the menu page next. I copied the
template from the first page which had the restaurant name, the greeting, as well as the footer. I then 
created a grid to display various food and drinks to successfully create the menu page. Upon completing
this, I was able to then move on to the last page which is the contact page. Again, following the template
from the first page. I then added a simple form where the user has to input their email so that the client
can contact them as well as a box where the customer can input any questions and concerns they have.

By writing this program, I have displayed various skills I have learned. I utilized Visual Studio Code which 
helped me write my program as well as used Git for version control. HTML was utilized to define the content
of the website, Bootstrap was used to build the website, JavaScript handled events and responses, and the
JQuery was used to include JavaScript plugins like modals, tooltips, etc...
